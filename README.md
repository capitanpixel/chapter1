CHAPTER 1

This project is a free site about writers from Argentina, in which they can upload the first chapter of their own books, and also read other's.
When you are logged in, you can: mark any book as "read", write a private message to the writer and comment his book.
You can access to the writer's profile template, where you can see all the books he/she has uploaded. 
This is a very important project for me (I am a writer myself), and I really want to publish it in the real web. I think this will help a lot to the new writers.

-------

I used Python (models and functions) to make it work. Also I used javascript for private messages and the "read" marks. And CSS to style every element in the HTML templates.

TEMPLATES: 
addbook.html : Add a new book
allbooks.html: List of all books
book.html: Description of the item
inbox.html: Private messages
index.html: Description of the project and button link to visit books
layout.html: bar navigations and links to static files (script.js and style.css)
login.html: log in a registered user
profile.html: List of book of an especific writer
read.html: List of books marked as "read"
register.html: Register a new user

------

I believe this project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, because it has everything we used in the others projects, like login/logout, register, models, user, forms, img url, etc etc.
Of course I did it with Django, providing funcions in views.py and models in models.py. Every url, like profile template, and each item template, is listed in urls.py.
Also, I think this is a very unique project, since it solves a real problem for artists: to share their own books and communicate with others writers.
Personally, I like the "read" button (using icons from the web), similar than the "like" button, but with a deeper meaning.
